Why I love peer-to-peer: 
 - Put ourselves in control
 - Reduce dependence on commercial infrastructure
 - Reduce energy use

I am interested in:
 - Peer discovery / NAT traversal
 - Cryptography for groups / group management / group moderation
 - Social backup / recovery
 - File sharing
 - Confidential computing - if you must use servers, make it possible for people to audit what is running on the server - through client attestation and reproducible builds.  

Confidential computing crates i authored:
 - [`tdx-quote`](https://docs.rs/tdx-quote) - Parse and verify TDX quotes
 - [`configfs-tsm`](https://docs.rs/configfs-tsm) - Generate quotes for remote attestation on confidential computing platforms using Linux's configfs-tsm filesystem interface

A lot of my code is on gitlab: [gitlab.com/pegpeg](https://gitlab.com/pegpeg)
